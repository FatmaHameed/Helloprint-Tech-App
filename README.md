# TestAutomation
This repository is created to do test automation for the spotify app which was part of technical assignment with Helloprint using [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/) test automation framework. It is used to test check the functionality of the app and verify it's able to reach Spotify API as well as verify it's correctly showing a list of top tracks on the UI


To run those tests in your local machine using operating system (windows10), you should do the following steps:



  1- Install cypress by running: **npm install**



  2- Run: **npx cypress open**



  3- Run the test cases by clicking on **test.spec.js** file inside the **integration** folder.
